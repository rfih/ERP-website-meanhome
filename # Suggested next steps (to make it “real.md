# Suggested next steps (to make it “real” on the production line)
A) Data persistence & integrity
Move to SQLite / PostgreSQL with schema:

orders(id, manufacture_code, customer, product, demand_date, delivery, quantity, datecreate, fengbian, wallpaper, jobdesc, created_at, updated_at)

tasks(id, order_id, group, task, quantity, completed, note, created_at, updated_at)

task_history(id, task_id, timestamp, delta)

Transactions on updates (task + history write) so your history never diverges from the value shown.

Server-side validation (clamp completed, require non‑negative quantities, forbid reducing quantity below completed).

B) Live operations
Flask‑SocketIO to push progress bar updates to all clients viewing the same order/station page—removes reloads entirely.

Role‑based views:

“Station” view = each group sees only its tasks (you have this with /stations) plus a “My queue today” filter.

“Planner” view = full order board with edit rights.

Scan/Type‑ahead to update: quick entry for +N completed pieces (on top of absolute values) for speed at stations.

C) Production analytics (what helps line performance)
Takt time & cycle time per station: you already store deltas; compute average minutes per piece over last N updates and show trend (sparkline) near each station.

WIP and bottleneck alerts:

If remaining at a station > threshold for > X hours, highlight row and notify planner.

If a downstream station has no incoming WIP scheduled within Y hours, warn “starvation risk.”

Throughput dashboard (daily/weekly): pieces completed per station/day; on‑time vs late to demand_date; rework counts.

Quality capture (print columns already scaffolded): add good_qty, defect_qty and line_time_min fields per work session; this enables first‑pass yield and basic OEE‑like indicators for manual stations.

D) Scheduling & capacity
Capacity model per station: planned available minutes per day and standard work content (mins/piece) per product/station; show load vs capacity to support forward scheduling and reliable delivery dates.

Auto‑drop active_groups when remaining == 0 for all tasks in a group (apply in /update_task); optionally auto‑activate next station when a prior station completes.

E) UX polish
Inline +/− buttons beside the completed input for single clicks (±1, ±5).

Keyboard shortcuts on Station view (Enter to submit; ↑/↓ to move to next task field).

Fast filters on Home (e.g., show only orders due in the next 7/14 days; show only orders where any station is late).

F) Reliability & audit
Immutable history: never rewrite history entries; show who made the change (add user_id once you introduce auth).

Undo (last change): store last value to allow quick revert within, say, 5 minutes.

G) Deployment
Gunicorn + Nginx and a persistent database. Add .env for config, and disable debug=True in production. Health check route /healthz.
